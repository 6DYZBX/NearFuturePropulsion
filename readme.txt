=================================
NEAR FUTURE PROPULSION PACK 0.6.1
=================================

This pack contains the advanced electric propulsion technologies

- Advanced Ion/Plasma Engines of many types
- Two new fuels: Lithium and ArgonGas, with various tanks available

============
INSTALLATION
============

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so. 

As this pack bundles ModuleManager v2.6.13 please check to make sure you have an older or concurrent version of the following files before overwriting:
· ModuleManager.2.6.13.dll

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place these engines in a set of nodes located after the stock Ion Propulsion node.

============
KSP-MINI-AVC
============

This mod includes version checking using MiniAVC (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745). 
If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version available. Data is only read from the internet and no personal information is sent. 
For a more comprehensive version checking experience, please download the KSP-AVC Plugin (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
